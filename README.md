# Non-dairy Godmother: 

This website is designed for a fictional vegan restaurant based in Cork, Ireland. 

This website has been created as the Fourth Milestone project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Diploma. It was built using a Full-Stack Toolkit. GitPod was used for writing the code for this website, as well as committing and pushing to GitHub. GitHub was then used to store the project after it had been pushed from GitPod. Once all the code had been written, Heroku was then used to deploy the website.

## Site Goals:

The goals for this site are as follows:
* Allow users to make a booking at the restaurant
* Allow users to edit or cancel their booking
* Allow users to sign up for a monthly newsletter
* Allow the restaurant owner to collect a database of customers who have booked with them 
* Allow the restaurant owner to collect a database for marketing purposes in the form of a monthly newsletter

## UX:

### User stories:
To demonstrate the Agile approach that was used for this project, GitHub issues were used and a Kanban board was used to record all the user stories. 
The user stories were categorised using different labels, i.e MO - *Must have*, SO - *Should Have* and CO - *Could have*.
Each story was then moved from 'To Do' to 'In Progress' to  'Done' as the project progressed, with CO stories moved to a future feature board.

## Development Planes:
To create a website that is comprehensive and informative for a user, as a developer you need to look at all aspects of the website and how someone who visits your website will use it. You have to consider all the user stories that have been outlined in the above sections.  

## Strategy
The strategy principal looks at user needs, as well product/service objectives. This website's target audience was broken down into three categories:
### Roles: 
* New User
* Existing User  

### Demographic:
* People aged between 16 - 40 years
* Working individuals with disposable income 

### Psychographic:
#### Lifestyle:
* People who follow a Vegan diet
* People who like eating out

#### Values:
* Reducing the number of animal products being used
* Environmentally Conscious

#### The website needs to allow users to:  
* Make a booking
* Log into their account 
* Edit a booking
* Cancel a booking 
* Sign up for a newsletter


#### The website needs to allow the restaurant owner to:  
* Collect information about their customer
* Track bookings that are coming into the restaurant 
* Manage the number of people per table via the booking model    

## Scope:  

With the structure in place, it was then time to move onto the scope plane. This was all about developing website requirements based on the goals set out in the strategy plane. These requirements are broken down into two categories. 
### Content Requirements:
1. The user will be looking for:
      * Location of the restaurant
      * Menus 
      * Opening Times

### Functionality Requirements:
1. The user will be able to:
      * Book a table at a certain time and date
      * Choose the number of people for the booking 
      * Choose the occasion and their prefered location in the restaurant
      * Edit bookings 
      * Cancel bookings 
      * Sign up for a newsletter

## Structure:

The information above was then used to create a structure for the website. Below is a site map showing how users can navigate the website intuitively 
<details>
<summary>Sitemap</summary>

### Color: 
For this website, I wanted to make it visually appealing and easy for people to read but also that it instantly came across as a 'Plant Power' website. As it is for a vegan restaurant I wanted the look to be clean and fresh. For this I picked green as my main color, using white as the contrasting color to make everything appear modern and clean.
I wanted to make sure the color scheme was not only eye-catching but also that it passed the LightHouse Accessibility test. 

To make sure text could be seen without issue on my chosen colors I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) color contrast checker.

### Font:
The font used for this project was Lora. This was imported from Google fonts and had a backup font of Sans Serif
 

### Images:

A lot of the imagery on this site was sourced from [Pexel](https://www.pexels.com/).

## Future Features:
Some future features I would like for this app are:
* Automated confirmation emails - that will be sent out to a user when they have made, edited or cancelled a booking
* Avoid overbookings - a backend feature that filters through all the bookings at a certain time and makes sure that the number of bookings does not exceed the number of available seats
* Dinner Club Login - where members can see the special offers that are only for members
* A Review page - this is a page where users can view reviews from previous diners but can also leave their reviews on the restaurant
* Gallery page - which would be linked to the restaurant's Instagram account 
* A shop - where users can buy vouchers, in-house wines, oils, dressings, etc

## Bugs:
1. The styling of the base page was not consistent across all pages on the site.
      * I had not included "{% load static %}" at the beginning of my base.html page. Once this was edited, all pages loaded correctly. 
1. The booking page was not loading, the below error message was coming up:
      * After reading through the yellow error page, it showed elements of the booking model didn't exist. I realised that I had changed elements of the model without making any migrations.
<details>
<summary>Booking Page Error</summary>

![Booking Page Error](/static/images/booking_page_error.png)
</details>

1. Bookings appeared to be completed on the site but nothing was happening in the backend. 
      * One reason this wasn't working was that I had manually entered the booking form into the bookings.html file as opposed to entering it using Django's built-in features.
      * Once this was fixed I then had to add the POST function to the bookings view. 

1. When trying to add specific users the booking form loaded but throw up a ProgrammingError when the user clicked on "Book Now"
      * I had to do a bit of troubleshooting to solve this one. After spending a bit of time researching and chatting with other students on Slack it was discovered that my view for the booking form was written for the older version of the booking model and had to be updated to include the user request.
      * After making these changes a user was now able to complete the booking and was redirected to the "Thank you" page.
<details>
<summary>ID Error</summary>

![ID Error](/static/images/id_error.png)
</details>

1. After correcting the above ID error it caused another ProgrammingError when I logged into the Django admin page and clicked on the bookings tab.
      * After countless attempts to solve this error but debugging, troubleshooting and reaching out to various programming communities (including Slack) I had to eventually contact the CI tutors. 
      * There were several attempts to find the issue in the code, looking at the 'list_display' in the admin.py file and correcting errors in the models.py file neither of which solved the problem.
      * We cleared the previous migrations to create the admin page again but the tutor noticed that the Heroku Postgres database was still connected. 
      * I reset the database from inside Heroku and performed the migrations, this corrected the issue 
<details>
<summary>Admin Page Error</summary>

![Admin Page Error](/static/images/admin_page_error.png)
</details>

1. Bookings were not showing up on the "My Bookings" page.
      * In my view, I had created a variable called my_bookings and then used this as the context in my view.
      * In the my_bookings.html page, I had created a for loop to iterate through the bookings of an authorised user and display them for editing or cancelling. However, in creating this for loop I had used the wrong variable. The context in my views.py file was "my_bookings" whereas in the loop I had used "for booking in bookings" Therefore there was a context/template mismatch. 
      * Once I removed the line of code in the view.py file which included the "my_bookings" variable as it was irrelevent and changed the context to bookings (as this was the query that was filtering the user's bookings) the bookings appear on the "My Bookings" page of the site. 

1. CSS was not appearing when the site was deployed.
      * When I delpoyed the site to Heroku, the site would be built but the CSS was not appearing.
      * This was something that I could not figure out as I had changed DEBUG to False and removed DISABLE COLLECTSTATIC from the config var (as per the CI vidoes)
      * I contacted the CI tutors who were able to walk me through what I needed to do: 
            * Set the DISABLE COLLECTSTAIC again in Heroku
            * Set the DEBUG back to True and commit the changes
            * Delete all files from my Cloudinary account
            * I then had to change the DEBUG back to FALSE before removing DISABLE COLLECTSTATIC from the config vars and commit and push the changes. 
            * This then allowed Heroku to Collectstatic and added all the static files to Cloudinary
      * All the CSS then worked perfectly on the site 
1. Server 500 error coming up when trying to register a user.
      * When trying to register a new user to the site and an email address was provided a server 500 error was coming up
      * After chatting with the tutors at CI it was discovered that if an email was provided the site send a verification email with a link, but as I don't have emails set up it was causing an issue.
      * To ensure email wasn't required to verify a login the following code was put into the settings.py file:
            * ***ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = 'username'***
            * ***ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'none'*** 
      * Setting the ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION to none means that the user does not need to click on a link to confirm login. 

1. PFD files not working on live site:
      * This was because of the Cloudinary account I have. When I tried to add a PDF file through Cloudinary I got the following error message:  
      ***Delivery of PDF assets is not currently permitted for this account.*** 
      * My solution to this problem was to create a seperate folder within my Django app called "documents" which housed all the relevant documentations for this project including all PDF files neede for the website and md files. 


1. During the testing stage, it was discovered that both the Newsletter form and the Book a Table form had elements of it that were not showing up as being a required field. After a quick search, I found that I needed to provide each field with a handle that checks if the field is required. I also added labels for each of these required fields, along with placeholders.
