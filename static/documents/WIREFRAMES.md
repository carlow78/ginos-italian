# Gino's Italian: 

This page contains the Wireframes for Gino's Italian, a fictional Italian restaurant website created for my forth milestone project with the Code Institute.

The wireframe were created to provide a visual concept of the site and to share my project idea with my mentor for our first meeting. 

Due to time constraints only 3 primary wireframes were created to depict the primary 3 elements of the website:

1. Index
2. Add Booking
3. Manage Reservation(s)
